Massa Piggy is a project on [MASSA](https://www.massa.net/) to bring habit and consequence into your savings.
You can participate by first depositing 1 MAS, and then you should check in everyday with 1 MAS for 100 days, and your money will be available to be withdrawn. The amount you deposit can be larger.

However if you miss the daily check-in the contract will send your funds to charity. (charity to be determined at the moment)

Current features:
- Daily Check-in 
- 100 day limit for withdrawal
- Missing a day punished by donation to charity (leveraging [MASSA's ASC technology](https://www.massa.net/asc))

Planned features:
- dApp for interacting through the browser
- [MASSA DeWeb](https://docs.massa.net/docs/deweb/home) dApp hosting
- Yield farming integration
- Proxy contract to swap in and out functionality
